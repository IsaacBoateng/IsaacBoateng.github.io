                    I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I'm

                    was working adults who don't have time to cook meals.
                    The user group confirmed the initial assumptions regarding Isaac's Takeouts' customers, but
                    further research uncovered that time constraints were not the sole factor preventing users from
                    cooking at home. The study revealed additional user challenges, including various obligations,
                    interests, or difficulties in obtaining groceries for cooking or visiting restaurants in person.</p>

                dream home, Realty Rise is here to simplify your

                at affordable prices in the United States. The
                strategy team at Realty Rise has identified a
                lack of general knowledge about affordable
                housing options and limited understanding
                about personal impact as crucial barriers for
                individuals seeking quality homes within their
                budget.</p>

                were utilized during user interviews. The majority of interview participants expressed frustration
                with the difficulty of finding great houses at affordable prices but admitted to not actively taking
                steps to address this issue. The research feedback indicated a strong willingness among users to
                actively engage in their home search process if they had access to an intuitive tool that could
                provide guidance and simplify the search for affordable housing.</p>
