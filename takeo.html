                    <b>What I learned:</b>
                    While designing the Isaac's takeout app, I learned
                    that the first ideas for the app are only the
                    beginning of the process. Usability studies and
                    peer feedback influenced each iteration of the
                    app's designs.

                        <b>One quote from peer feedback:</b><i class="ti">
                            “The app made it so easy and fun to select my
                            food and add dishes that goes together. I would
                            definitely use this app as a go-to for a delicious,
                            fast, and even healthy meal.”</i>
