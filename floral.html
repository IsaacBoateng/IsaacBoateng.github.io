                    <b>What I learned:</b>
                    During the design process of the Blooming Delights app, 
                    I discovered that the initial concepts for the app are merely 
                    the inception of the journey. The incorporation of usability studies and 
                    constructive input from peers significantly shaped each subsequent iteration of the app's designs.
